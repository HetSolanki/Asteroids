# Asteroids Game

This is a simple Asteroids game built using Python and the `pygame` module. The game involves controlling a spaceship that must avoid asteroids and shoot them to survive.

**Note**: Currently, the game is configured to work on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and may not run natively on Windows. A fix for native Windows support is coming soon.
